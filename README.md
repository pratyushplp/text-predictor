# MLtextpredict 
This was created as a miniproject for our course Machine Learning COMP 484 at Kathmandu University.

This project works with TensorFlow 1.1 and Keras 2.0 with python as the core programming language. 

Description:
As a mini project for COMP 484 (Machine Learning) course, we built a simple text predicting
application “Text predictor”. Text predictor is an application that facilitates typing by suggesting
possible words the user may wish to insert in a text field. Predictions are based on the context of
previous words and characters in the sentence.
Here, a sequence of text is taken as a input and is fed to the LSTM network based upon which it predicts 
and completes the word.

Dataset being used:
Friedrich Nietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil is used as dataset for our model. The text is not that large and our
model can be trained relatively fast. Beyond good and evil is a free e-book
available in the internet.
